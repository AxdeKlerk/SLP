## 9. Testing

All functionality was tested manually by working through user stories. Testing was carried out in Google Chrome, Edge, Brave and Firefox across desktop and mobile screen sizes. DevTools were used to check responsiveness and console errors. Forms and dynamic elements were tested for validation, correct behaviour, and feedback.

### 9.1 User Stories

#### 9.1.1 Ticket Oversell Guardrail

As a *fan* buying tickets I want *the checkout system to stop me from purchasing more tickets than the event’s available capacity*,  
so that I *cannot buy a ticket to an oversold event with a clear message so that I clearly understand why my order cannot proceed*.

**What Was Tested:**  
I tested that the checkout view prevented users from overselling tickets for an event. As a user, I wanted to see a clear error message if I tried to purchase more tickets than the event’s available capacity, so that I would know the purchase could not go through.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [x] If the quantity of tickets in the basket exceeded the event’s effective capacity, the checkout view blocked the order.  
- [x] An error message was displayed on the basket page, positioned directly above the checkout button.  
- [x] The error message included the specific event name to avoid confusion when multiple events were in the basket.  
- [x] Normal checkout proceeded when the basket quantity was within capacity.  

**Tasks Completed:**  
- [x] Added `capacity` field to `Venue` and `ticket_capacity` field to `Event`.  
- [x] Implemented `effective_capacity()` method in `Event` to enforce venue and event limits.  
- [x] Moved the oversell guardrail check to the top of `checkout_view` so it runs before POST handling.  
- [x] Updated basket template to display error messages to the left of the checkout button.  
- [x] Verified error messages correctly identified the event that exceeded capacity.  

**Notes:**  
Initially, the oversell check did not run because it was inside the `if request.method == "POST":` block, and the *checkout button* triggered a `GET` request. Moving the *guardrail check* above the `POST` block fixed the issue. The error messages now displays correctly, styled in line with the project theme, and gives users immediate feedback before completing an order.
