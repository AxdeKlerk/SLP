## Security Bug

**Bug:**

Accidentally committed the *Django* SECRET_KEY to *GitHub* in the initial commit.

**Fix:**

Regenerated a new secure key using get_random_secret_key()

Stored it safely in a .env file (excluded via .gitignore)

Updated settings.py to load the key using python-decouple

Removed the entire *Git* history by deleting .git, reinitializing, and creating a fresh, secure initial commit

Force-pushed the cleaned repo to *GitHub*

**Lesson Learned:**

Even one leaked commit can expose sensitive data permanently. Using environment variables and .gitignore from the start prevents accidental leaks. Rewriting history should be done early if needed, before more commits make it harder.

## Deployment Issue

**Bug:**

After deploying to Heroku, the app crashed with an Application Error and later returned a 404 page instead of loading the homepage. The logs revealed that some environment variables were missing, and Django couldn’t find SECRET_KEY or DATABASE_URL. Even after fixing that, the app loaded but still returned a 404 error for all routes.

**Fix:**

Added missing environment variables to Heroku using:

    heroku config:set SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
    heroku config:set DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"

Added DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 to stop Heroku failing on missing static files during build.

The 404 error wasn’t caused by routing issues or template placement — the problem was that the templates were in the templates/ folder, but the view was trying to render core/home.html, which didn’t exist.

**Fix:**

Updated the views to match the actual template paths. Since the HTML files were directly inside templates/ (not in a core/ subfolder), we changed from:

    return render(request, 'core/home.html') to return render(request, 'home.html')

(Same for about.html and contact.html.)

**Lesson Learned:**

Heroku needs all environment variables your app depends on — even if it runs locally.

If Django throws a 404 after deployment but the URL paths look correct, double-check the template paths in your render() function.

Don't assume it's a folder problem — sometimes it's just the wrong string in the render() call.
