## Security Bug

**Bug:**

Accidentally committed the Django SECRET_KEY to GitHub in the initial commit.

**Fix:**

Regenerated a new secure key using get_random_secret_key()

Stored it safely in a .env file (excluded via .gitignore)

Updated settings.py to load the key using python-decouple

Removed the entire Git history by deleting .git, reinitializing, and creating a fresh, secure initial commit

Force-pushed the cleaned repo to GitHub

**Lesson Learned:**

Even one leaked commit can expose sensitive data permanently. Using environment variables and .gitignore from the start prevents accidental leaks. Rewriting history should be done early if needed, before more commits make it harder.
